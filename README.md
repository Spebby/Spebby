### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Spebby, I'm an amatuer game developer hoping to make something enjoyable and special in my free time, while continuing to learn more about computers and the languages in which we communicate with them.

I'm currently working on [Egg Rush](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/807164) and "Project T.V".
