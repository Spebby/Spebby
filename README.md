### Hello there,

<hr>

My name is Thom (Spebby) Mott,
I'm a game developer hoping to make something enjoyable, while continuing to learn more about computers and the ways in which we communicate with them. I'm currently a student at the University of California, Santa Cruz persuing a batchelors in their Game Design program, and a minor in their Computer Science program. I am most comfortable with the C family of languages, but have experience in Python, Java and JS/TypeScript.

* What am I cooking?
  * An AR Mobile application meant to build community and climate resilience
  * A Chess Engine using bitboards and other advanced techniques built in Dear ImGui
  * A curated modding project for the video game [Unturned](https://store.steampowered.com/app/304930/Unturned/)
