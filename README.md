### Hello there,

<hr>

My name is Thom (Spebby) Mott, I'm an game developer and aspiring graphics programmer hoping to make something enjoyable and special, while continuing to learn more about computers and the languages in which we communicate with them. I'm currently a student at the University of California, Santa Cruz.
